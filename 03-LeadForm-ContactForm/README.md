# Lead Forms & Contact System - Quick Start Guide

## üìã What This System Does
The Valta website has a lead capture system that:
1. Saves every form submission to a database (never loses data)
2. Sends email notifications to the team
3. Shows the source (which form/page was used)

## üöÄ Current Status
‚úÖ **Contact Form is LIVE and WORKING**
- URL: https://valta.ca/contact
- Emails going to: bc@crowestudio.com (temporary)
- Future recipient: clientcare@valta.ca (needs domain verification)

## üìß Daily Management

### Check for New Submissions
1. **Email**: Check bc@crowestudio.com for notifications
2. **Database**: View all submissions at:
   - https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ngovnamnjmexdpjtcnky/editor
   - Table: `contact_submissions`

### Test the Form
```bash
# Quick test to verify everything works
node test-form.js
```

## üîß Common Tasks

## ü§ù Handoff Notes

**For Your Assistant:**
1. The system saves everything to the database first (data is never lost)
2. Email notifications are secondary (nice to have but not critical)
3. Each form shows where it came from (valta.ca/contact)
4. Test with `node test-form.js` whenever you're unsure
5. The database is the source of truth - check there if emails aren't arriving

**What You DON'T Need to Worry About:**
- The system is stable and tested
- Data loss is prevented by design
- Forms are mobile-friendly
- Everything auto-deploys from GitHub

**What to Monitor:**
- Check for submissions daily
- Export for CRM weekly
- Clean test submissions monthly

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always test after changes**: Run `node test-form.js`
2. **Database first**: If emails fail, data is still saved
3. **Source matters**: Each form says where it came from
4. **Keep it simple**: No colors, no urgency alerts in emails
5. **Company field**: Always beside phone number (design decision)
