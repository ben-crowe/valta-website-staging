# CRITICAL PROJECT NOTE - DO NOT DELETE

## WE ARE WORKING ON: valta-website-staging

**CORRECT PROJECT**: valta-website-staging
**CORRECT URL**: https://valta-website-staging.vercel.app/
**GITHUB REPO**: ben-crowe/valta-website-staging

## CONFUSION EXPLANATION

I made ALL the code changes in the LOCAL directory:
- `/Users/bencrowe/Development/Valta-Website/`

But this local directory is configured to deploy to a DIFFERENT Vercel project:
- Project name: valta-frontend-staging-2025
- This is the WRONG project!

## THE PROBLEM

1. All our code changes (forms, navigation, Supabase) were made locally
2. These changes were pushed to GitHub
3. But they likely went to the WRONG GitHub repo
4. Which means they deployed to the WRONG Vercel project

## WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

We need to verify:
1. Which GitHub repo this local folder is connected to
2. Where our changes actually went
3. Get the changes to the CORRECT project (valta-website-staging)

## DO NOT CONFUSE THESE

❌ WRONG: valta-frontend-staging-2025
✅ RIGHT: valta-website-staging

The domain valta.ca is now correctly pointing to valta-website-staging, but our changes might not be there!
