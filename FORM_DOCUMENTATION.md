## 2. Contact Form (`/contact`)

### Current Behavior:
**⚠️ SIMULATED ONLY - NO BACKEND CONNECTION**

#### What Happens Now:
1. User fills out form with:
   - Name (required)
   - Email (required)
   - Phone (optional)
   - Request Type (dropdown)
   - Property Type (dropdown)
   - Timeline (dropdown)
   - Message (required)

2. On Submit:
   - Form shows loading state for 1.5 seconds
   - Shows green success message: "Thank You! Your message has been received. We'll get back to you within 24 hours to discuss your appraisal needs."
   - Form data is NOT actually sent anywhere
   - Team receives NO notification

#### Code Location:
- File: `/app/contact/page.tsx`
- Lines: 34-43 (handleSubmit function)

### ❌ MISSING COMPONENTS:
- No email notification to team
- No database storage
- No integration with any email service
- Form data is lost after submission

---

## 3. Appraisal Request Form (`/request-appraisal`)

### Current Behavior:
**✅ CONNECTED TO SUPABASE DATABASE**

#### What Happens Now:
1. User fills out form with:
   - **Required Fields** (only 4):
     - First Name
     - Last Name
     - Email
     - Phone
   - **Optional Fields**:
     - Client Title
     - Organization
     - Organization Address
     - Property Name
     - Property Address
     - Property Type
     - Intended Use
     - Asset Condition
     - Additional Notes
     - File Uploads

2. On Submit:
   - Form validates required fields
   - Attempts to save to Supabase database table: `job_submissions`
   - If database fails, tries minimal submission with critical fields
   - Files uploaded to Supabase storage bucket: `job-files`
   - Shows success message after submission

#### Database Structure:
- Table: `job_submissions`
- Storage: `job-files` bucket for document uploads

#### Code Locations:
- Form Page: `/app/request-appraisal/page.tsx`
- Submit Hook: `/hooks/useAppraisalFormSubmission.ts`
- Supabase Config: `/lib/supabase.ts`

### ⚠️ PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- ✅ Data IS saved to Supabase database
- ✅ File uploads work
- ❌ Team receives NO email notification
- ❌ No automated email to client
- ❌ No Supabase database triggers for notifications

---

## 4. Email Notification Status

### Current State: **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

Neither form currently sends email notifications to:
- Your team when someone submits
- The client as confirmation

### What's Needed for Email Notifications:

#### Option 1: Supabase Edge Functions (Recommended)
```sql
-- Example database trigger needed in Supabase
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_submission()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Call Edge Function to send email
  PERFORM net.http_post(
    url := 'https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-email',
    body := jsonb_build_object(
      'to', 'clientcare@valta.ca',
      'subject', 'New Appraisal Request',
      'data', NEW
    )
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER on_submission_created
  AFTER INSERT ON job_submissions
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_new_submission();
```

#### Option 2: API Route with Email Service
- Add Next.js API route
- Integrate with email service (SendGrid, Resend, etc.)
- Update form to call API endpoint

#### Option 3: Third-Party Form Service
- Replace with Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.
- Automatic email notifications included

## 5. Recommended Actions

### Immediate Fixes Needed:

1. **Contact Form** - Needs complete backend:
   - Connect to Supabase or email service
   - Add team notification
   - Store submissions for follow-up

2. **Email Notifications** - For both forms:
   - Set up email service (SendGrid/Resend recommended)
   - Create email templates
   - Add team notification emails
   - Add client confirmation emails

3. **Twitter/X Link** - Currently placeholder (`#`)
   - Update with actual company Twitter/X URL

### Email Notification Requirements:

#### For Team (clientcare@valta.ca):
```
Subject: New [Contact/Appraisal] Request - [Client Name]

New submission received:
- Name: [Full Name]
- Email: [Email]
- Phone: [Phone]
- Property Type: [Type]
- Message/Notes: [Content]

View in dashboard: [Link to Supabase dashboard]
```

#### For Client (auto-reply):
```
Subject: We've Received Your Request - Valta Property Valuations

Thank you for contacting Valta Property Valuations.

We've received your [contact/appraisal] request and will respond within 24 hours.

Your submission details:
[Summary of what they submitted]

If you need immediate assistance, please call us at (587) 801-5151.

## 7. Priority Implementation Order

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Set up email notifications for Appraisal Form
   - This is actively collecting data but team doesn't know about submissions

2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Connect Contact Form to backend
   - Currently losing all contact attempts

3. **MEDIUM**: Add client auto-reply emails
   - Improves customer experience

4. **LOW**: Fix Twitter/X link in footer
   - Minor issue, non-functional link

---

## Notes:
- All forms have proper validation
- Phone numbers auto-format to (XXX) XXX-XXXX
- Forms are mobile responsive
- Success/error states are properly handled in UI
- Main issue is lack of email notification system
