  Since you're already using Lucide React in your project, here's the best link to browse all available icons:

  ðŸ”— Lucide Icons Browser: https://lucide.dev/icons

  This is the official Lucide icon library you're already using. You can:
  - Search for any icon
  - Preview them all
  - Click on any icon to see the code
  - Filter by categories

  Other excellent icon libraries you can browse:

  1. Heroicons (by Tailwind team): https://heroicons.com/
  2. Tabler Icons: https://tabler-icons.io/
  3. Phosphor Icons: https://phosphoricons.com/
  4. Radix Icons: https://www.radix-ui.com/icons
  5. Feather Icons: https://feathericons.com/

  Since you already have Lucide installed, you can use ANY icon from https://lucide.dev/icons by just importing it like:
  import { Building2, TrendingUp, ShieldCheck, Zap } from 'lucide-react'

  Browse through those links and let me know which specific icons you'd like to use, and I can update your site with
  better, more specific icons than the generic ones currently there!
