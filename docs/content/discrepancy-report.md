## ❌ CRITICAL DISCREPANCIES (Not Yet Updated)

### 🚨 CRITICAL #1: Homepage Hero Headline

**Issue**: Homepage headline does NOT match requested change
**Priority**: HIGHEST - This is the first thing visitors see

**Expected** (from change request line 9):
> "Commercial Real Estate Appraisals Across Western Canada"

**Actual** (on live site line 19):
> "Professional Commercial Property Appraisals"

**Impact**: Primary value proposition messaging inconsistent with approved copy. Misses opportunity to immediately communicate geographic scope.

**Recommendation**: Update homepage hero headline immediately to match approved copy.

---

### 🚨 CRITICAL #2: Homepage Hero Subheadline

**Issue**: Subheadline content doesn't match suggested structure

**Expected** (from change request lines 10-11):
> "AACI-certified valuations for multifamily, self-storage, industrial, and commercial properties. Lender-ready reports delivered in 2–3 weeks — serving clients across Alberta, BC and Western Canada."

**Actual** (on live site lines 21-22):
> "Expert valuations for multifamily, self-storage, and commercial properties across Western Canada. Lender-ready reports in 2-3 weeks."

**Specific Differences**:
1. Missing "AACI-certified" lead-in (important credential)
2. Missing "industrial" in property type list
3. Missing specific provinces "Alberta, BC and Western Canada" detail
4. Uses "Expert valuations" instead of "AACI-certified valuations"

**Impact**: Weaker credential positioning, missing key property type, less specific geographic coverage

---

### 🚨 CRITICAL #3: Service Cards Descriptions

**Issue**: Service card descriptions don't match suggested enhanced copy

**MULTIFAMILY CARD**:

**Expected** (from change request lines 24):
> "Accurate, lender-ready valuations for apartment and townhouse rental properties and development-ready land across Western Canada."

**Actual** (on live site line 40):
> "In-depth valuations for purpose-built apartment and townhouse properties"

**Missing Elements**:
- "Accurate, lender-ready" quality descriptors
- "development-ready land" service mention
- Geographic scope "across Western Canada"

---

**SELF-STORAGE CARD**:

**Expected** (from change request lines 25):
> "Specialized appraisals for self-storage facilities, with market analysis on occupancy, rental rates, and local trends."

**Actual** (on live site lines 43-44):
> "Specialized appraisals for next generation self-storage and mini-storage facilities"

**Missing Elements**:
- Market analysis specifics (occupancy, rental rates, local trends)
- More comprehensive service description

---

**COMMERCIAL CARD**:

**Expected** (from change request line 26):
> "AACI-certified appraisals for office, retail and industrial buildings and development-ready land."

**Actual** (on live site lines 46-47):
> "Professional appraisals for office buildings, retail spaces, and industrial properties"

**Missing Elements**:
- "AACI-certified" credential lead-in
- "development-ready land" service mention
- "buildings" specificity vs generic "properties"

---

## ❌ MEDIUM PRIORITY DISCREPANCIES

### Homepage "Why Choose Valta" Section

**Issue**: Section headline and supporting content don't match suggested structure

**Expected Headline** (from change request line 30):
> "Why Choose Valta for Your Commercial Property Appraisal"

**Actual Headline** (on live site line 51):
> "Why Choose Valta"

**Missing**: More descriptive headline with "Commercial Property Appraisal" specificity

**Expected Supporting Content** (from change request lines 31-32):
> "Built by developers, for developers — we provide AACI-certified commercial real estate appraisals across Western Canada. Our experience on both sides of the transaction means faster, more accurate, lender-ready reports."

**Actual Supporting Content** (on live site lines 53-54):
> "Built by developers and investors, for developers and investors. We have been on your side of the table and understand the importance of getting fast, accurate and lender-ready reports to fund a deal."

**Differences**:
1. Missing "AACI-certified" mention
2. Missing "commercial real estate appraisals" specificity
3. Missing "across Western Canada" geographic scope
4. Different phrasing structure

---

### "Why Choose Valta" - Four Key Advantages

**Issue**: Feature descriptions don't match suggested enhanced copy

**FAST DELIVERY**:

**Expected** (from change request line 34):
> "Fast Delivery – Receive your commercial appraisal in 2–3 weeks, compared to the 4–6 week industry standard."

**Actual** (on live site lines 57-58):
> "Fast Delivery - 2-3 week turnaround vs 4-6 week industry standard"

**Missing**: More complete sentence structure, "commercial appraisal" specificity, "Receive your" customer-focused language

---

**AACI CERTIFIED**:

**Expected** (from change request line 35):
> "AACI-Certified Expertise – Professional standards and lender-approved valuations for commercial, multifamily, and self-storage properties."

**Actual** (on live site lines 60-61):
> "AACI Certified - Professional, peer reviewed and lender-approved appraisals for commercial, multifamily, and self-storage properties."

**Differences**: Minor - "Expertise" vs basic "Certified", "peer reviewed" added (positive addition not in request)

---

**DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE**:

**Expected** (from change request line 36):
> "Developer Experience – Firsthand insight into market conditions, construction realities, and investment challenges."

**Actual** (on live site lines 63-64):
> "Developer & Investor Experience - Real-world development and investor experience and deep market knowledge"

**Differences**: Missing specific detail about "construction realities" and "investment challenges"

---

**LENDER READY**:

**Expected** (from change request line 37):
> "Lender-Ready Reports – Accepted by all major financial institutions in Western Canada"

**Actual** (on live site lines 66-67):
> "Lender Ready - Reports accepted by all major financial institutions"

**Missing**: Geographic specificity "in Western Canada"

---

### Homepage About Section

**Issue**: Homepage About section doesn't include suggested content structure

**Expected** (from change request lines 40-50):
- Headline: "About Valta Property Valuations"
- Founder introduction: "Founded by Chris Chornohos, an active real estate developer and AACI designated appraiser..."
- Three key points with specific metrics:
  - "15+ Years of Experience"
  - "Specialized Expertise – Focused on multifamily property appraisals and self-storage facility valuations across Alberta, BC, and Saskatchewan"
  - "Serving Western Canada Investors"

**Actual** (on live site):
No dedicated "About" section on homepage. The "What Makes Valta Different?" section (lines 69-84) addresses similar themes but with different structure and messaging.

**Impact**: Missing structured about section with founder credential and specific expertise positioning as suggested.

---

### About Page - Hero Section

**Issue**: Hero subheadline doesn't match suggested trust indicator

**Expected** (from change request line 63):
> "Trust Indicator: Trusted by 200+ property investors and lenders across Western Canada"

**Actual** (on live site line 106):
> "We understand both sides of every transaction because we've been there ourselves."

**Missing**: The "200+ clients" trust indicator in hero position. (Note: This trust indicator DOES appear on homepage hero, just not About page hero)

---

### About Page - Unique Value Proposition Section

**Issue**: Three key differentiators don't match suggested enhanced copy structure

**Expected Format** (from change request lines 83-86):
> Three Key Differentiators:
> • Enhanced Understanding - Real time knowledge of pro forma assumptions and construction practicalities based on real development and ownership experience
> • More Accurate Valuations - Sophisticated ability to project stabilized values critical for development financing and investment decisions
> • Innate Urgency Appreciation - Understanding of financing deadlines and rate lock pressures that drive real estate development timelines

**Actual** (on live site lines 112-127):
Section titled "Finally, an Appraisal Firm That Speaks Your Language" with three features:
1. Enhanced Understanding - Accurate assessment of market conditions, valuation assumptions and true comparables based on real world experience
2. Accurate Valuations - Sophisticated ability to project stabilized values critical for development, acquisition and renewal financing
3. Real Urgency - Understanding of financing conditions and rate lock pressures that drive real estate deal timelines

**Differences**:
- Feature 1: Missing "pro forma assumptions" and "construction practicalities" specifics
- Feature 2: Close match but "development financing and investment decisions" vs "development, acquisition and renewal financing"
- Feature 3: "Real Urgency" vs suggested "Innate Urgency Appreciation", missing "financing deadlines" specific mention

## ⚠️ CONTENT GAPS & PLACEHOLDER CONTENT

### 🔴 GAP #1: Development Projects Section (CRITICAL)

**Location**: About Page - "Development Projects Showcase" section
**Status**: PLACEHOLDER CONTENT NOT REPLACED

**Change Request Note** (line 185-186):
> "Real development project details and descriptions
> Can use the ones on the previous WordPress site unless otherwise specified."

**Actual** (on live site - NOT VISIBLE):
The content audit document does NOT show any development projects section on the About page. The change request document shows placeholder structure for:
- Project 1: 45-Unit Multifamily Development [Placeholder description needed]
- Project 2: Mixed-Use Commercial Project [Placeholder description needed]
- Project 3: Self-Storage Facility [Placeholder description needed]

**Impact**: HIGH - Missing credibility-building showcase of actual development work. This is important social proof.

**Recommendation**: Either:
1. Add development projects section to About page with real project details from previous site
2. OR explicitly decide to remove this section if not desired
3. Client needs to confirm preference

---

### 🔴 GAP #2: Founder Bio Section Status

**Location**: About Page - Founder Story Section
**Status**: UNCERTAIN - May be removed per change note

**Change Request Note** (line 67):
> "🔄 CHANGE NOTE (Aug 7, 2025 /bc): As Ben and Chris discussed, potentially removing this Chris bio section and adding it to a new Team section or sub-section of the contact"

**Current State**:
- Content audit shows NO founder bio visible on About page
- Change request shows placeholder bio content with "[END PLACEHOLDER - REPLACE WITH ACTUAL BIO]"

**Questions**:
1. Was the founder bio intentionally removed pending Team section creation?
2. If so, when will Team section be created?
3. Where will founder bio ultimately live?

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Important credential and trust-building content missing. Founder story is powerful differentiator.

**Recommendation**: Client needs to confirm:
- Temporary removal or permanent?
- Timeline for Team section creation if that's the plan
- Interim solution if Team section delayed

---

### 🟡 GAP #3: Services Page Descriptions

**Issue**: Service descriptions don't fully match suggested enhanced copy

**MULTIFAMILY SECTION**:

**Expected** (from change request lines 143):
> "Our primary specialization with deep expertise in apartment and townhouse rental properties. We understand the complexities of purpose built rentals and provide comprehensive market analysis and appraisal reports."

**Actual** (on live site lines 178-179):
> "Our primary specialization with deep expertise in purpose-built rental apartments and townhome properties. We understand the complexities of income-producing multifamily properties and provide comprehensive market analysis."

**Differences**: Minor wording variations, live version actually more specific with "income-producing" mention

---

**SELF-STORAGE SECTION**:

**Expected** (from change request lines 154-155):
> Service Features:
> • Climate-controlled and standard storage units
> • Facility operations analysis
> • Market positioning assessment
> • Occupancy and rental rate analysis
> • Investment potential evaluation

**Actual** (on live site lines 196-199):
> Services:
> • New Generation Self Storage
> • Mini Storage
> • Land Valuation

**Missing**: The detailed feature list from change request. Live version shows service types, not analytical capabilities.

---

**COMMERCIAL PROPERTY SECTION**:

**Expected** (from change request lines 167-172):
> Service Features:
> • Office buildings and complexes
> • Industrial and warehouse facilities
> • Development land analysis
> • Highest and best use analysis
> • All three approaches to value

**Actual** (on live site lines 207-211):
> Services:
> • Office buildings and campus
> • Industrial and warehouse facilities
