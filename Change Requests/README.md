# Change Requests - Valta Website

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

### Workflow Overview

This is the proven workflow for implementing and verifying website changes. Follow this process to ensure all edits are properly deployed and confirmed live.

---

## 📋 Implementation Workflow

### 1. **Receive Change Request**
- Client provides marked-up document (Google Doc, Word, etc.)
- Create a dated checklist file: `YYYY-MM-DD-Edit-Review.md`
- Extract ALL changes into organized checklist by page

**Template:**
```markdown
## [PAGE NAME] (URL)

### [Section Name]:
- ☐ Change #X: "old text" → "new text"
```

---

### 2. **Implement Changes (Marcel + Terminal)**

**CRITICAL: Check Shared Components First**
- ✅ `components/site-header.tsx` - Navigation menu (appears on ALL pages)
- ✅ `components/site-footer.tsx` - Footer links (appears on ALL pages)
- ✅ Page-specific content files (app/**/page.tsx)

**Common Gotcha:**
> Changes to shared components affect EVERY page. If you update page content but miss the header/footer, the old text will still appear site-wide.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Use `Grep` to find all instances of text to change
2. Use `Read` to view files
3. Use `Edit` to make precise changes
4. Run lint/typecheck before committing

---

### 3. **Deploy via Vercel CLI (PREFERRED METHOD)**

**Why CLI > Webhook:**
- ✅ Real-time confirmation of deployment success
- ✅ Bypasses webhook queue delays
- ✅ Exit code 0 = guaranteed live
- ✅ Faster (2-3 minutes vs 5+ minutes)

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: Description of changes"
git push origin main
npx vercel deploy --prod
```

**Wait for:**
- "Building..." → "Completing" → Exit code: 0
- This confirms deployment succeeded

---

### 4. **Verification via Playwright (MOST RELIABLE)**

**Why Playwright > Claude Desktop Web Scraping:**
- ✅ Fresh browser session (no cache)
- ✅ Real DOM inspection (not web scraping)
- ✅ Can click elements and test interactions
- ✅ Can take screenshots for evidence
- ✅ Programmatic verification (no human error)

**Verification Steps:**

```bash
# Navigate to page
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate({ url: "https://valta.ca" })

# Take snapshot (shows all text/elements)
mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot()

# Click dropdown to verify menu
mcp__playwright__browser_click({ element: "Services button", ref: "eXX" })

# Take screenshot for evidence
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot({ filename: "verification.png" })
```

**What to Check:**
- ✅ Main page content (check 3-5 key changes per page)
- ✅ Navigation dropdown menu text
- ✅ Footer links text
- ✅ Footer company details section

**Pro Tip:** Take screenshots of BEFORE and AFTER for client evidence.

---

### 5. **Client Review & Handoff**

**Create Final Checklist:**
- All items marked ☑ ✅
- Deployment info (date, commit hash)
- Status: "✅ LIVE at https://valta.ca"

**For Client Cache Issues:**
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Test in incognito/private window
- Clear browser cache for valta.ca

---

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Changes marked complete but not live"

**Root Cause:** Shared components (header/footer) weren't updated

**Solution:**
1. Search both page files AND component files:
   ```bash
   Grep({ pattern: "old text", output_mode: "files_with_matches" })
   ```
2. Check these files:
   - `components/site-header.tsx`
   - `components/site-footer.tsx`
   - All `app/**/page.tsx` files

### Issue: "Deployment succeeded but changes don't show"

**Root Cause:** Browser cache

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Verify in incognito window
- Use Playwright (guaranteed fresh browser)

### Issue: "Vercel webhook slow or stuck"

**Root Cause:** Webhook queue delays

**Solution:**
- Use Vercel CLI: `npx vercel deploy --prod`
- Bypasses webhook entirely
- Get real-time confirmation
