**Fair point - I agree completely.**

**For the memory/documentation:**
- Web verification requires VISUAL confirmation (screenshots or manual checking)
- Browser cache causes false negatives
- My web_fetch tool gives incomplete/cached HTML
- Always verify deployment changes in incognito mode or with hard refresh
- Don't rely solely on AI tool verification for client-facing deliverables

Want me to add this to Marcel's memory system as a lesson learned?

Meanwhile, here's your **clean completion checklist:**
