## 3. Technical Implementation

### New Files to Create
- `/app/careers/page.tsx` - Main careers page component

### Form Handling Options
1. **Option A**: Use existing Supabase edge function pattern (like contact form)
2. **Option B**: Create new edge function specifically for career applications
3. **Option C**: Simple client-side form with email submission

**Recommended**: Option B - Create dedicated career application handler that:
- Stores applications in Supabase database
- Sends notification email to HR/admin
- Handles file upload for resume (store in Supabase Storage)

### Database Schema (if using Supabase)
```sql
CREATE TABLE career_applications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT,
  linkedin_url TEXT,
  portfolio_url TEXT,
  resume_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  how_heard TEXT,
  position_applied TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 4. Design Considerations

### Layout Style

- Use similar hero section style as other pages
- Card-based job listings
- Clean, professional form design
- Responsive mobile layout

### Visual Elements

- Job cards with hover effects
- Form validation feedback
- Success/error messages for submission
- Loading states during file upload

---

## 5. Content Requirements

### Job Descriptions (Need from Client)
- Detailed job descriptions for each role
- Responsibilities and requirements
- Qualifications
- Benefits/perks (optional)
- Salary range (optional)

### Form Submission Behavior
- Success message after submission
- Email confirmation to applicant

## 7. Questions for Client

1. **Job Descriptions**: Do you have detailed job descriptions, or should we use placeholder content for now?
2. **Application Storage**: Where should applications be stored? (Supabase database, email only, or third-party ATS?)
3. **File Storage**: Should resumes be stored in Supabase Storage or sent as email attachments?
4. **Notification Email**: What email should receive application notifications?
5. **Additional Positions**: Will there be more positions added in the future? Should we build for scalability?
