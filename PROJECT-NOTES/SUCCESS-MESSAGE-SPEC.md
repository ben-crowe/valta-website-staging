# Contact Form Success Message Specification

## Current Design (September 25, 2025)

### Visual Design
- **Background**: Light gray (slate-50) - subtle, professional
- **Icon**: Blue checkmark in circle (blue-100 background, blue-600 icon)
- **Layout**: Centered, clean spacing
- **Style**: Matches overall site aesthetic (blue/gray theme)

### Text Content
- **Heading**: "Thank You!"
- **Message**: "Your message has been received. We'll get back to you within the day to discuss how we can work together."
- **Button**: "Return to Website"

### Button Behavior
- **Text**: "Return to Website"
- **Action**: Redirects to homepage (/)
- **Style**: White background with gray border, shadow on hover

## Design Decisions
- Changed from green to blue/gray (matches brand better)
- Changed "24 hours" to "within the day" (more personal)
- Changed "appraisal needs" to "how we can work together" (broader, more collaborative)
- Changed button from "Send Another Message" to "Return to Website" (cleaner user flow)

## Implementation
- Location: `/app/contact/page.tsx` lines 182-202
- Triggered when: Form submission successful
- Duration: Stays visible until user clicks button or refreshes

## What NOT to Change
- Keep it simple and clean
- No additional colors
- No urgency messaging
- No multiple buttons or complex options
