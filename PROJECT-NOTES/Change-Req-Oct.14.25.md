What Makes Valta Different?
Here's the thing about traditional appraisers: They've never sweated a rate lock deadline. Never felt the stress during a deal because the valuation took six weeks. Never had to explain to a lender or mortgage broker why the appraisal report doesn't reflect the upside potential of a development or value add play.
We're different because we've been you. Active developers and investors who got tired of appraisals that missed the mark. So we became AACI-certified appraisers ourselves—combining 20+ years of boots-on-the-ground development and investor experience with professional valuation expertise. The result? Reports that actually reflect current construction costs, land values, rental market dynamics, and what makes a project viable.
When you work with Valta, you get:
Someone who speaks fluent "developer and investor"—no translation needed.
Deep expertise in multifamily and self-storage—where the action is.
Coverage across Western Canada—because opportunities don't stop at city limits.
Ready to experience the difference? Let's talk about your deal and how we can help you close faster with confidence.

Here's What Actually Sets Us Apart
You know that sinking feeling when your appraisal takes six weeks? Rate locks expire. Sellers get nervous. Deals die. That's why we turned the traditional timeline on its head—delivering comprehensive reports in 2-3 weeks without cutting corners. Because in commercial real estate, time kills deals.
And here's something most appraisers won't tell you: half the reports that cross lenders' desks come back for revisions. More delays. More frustration. We engineered our process differently. Every report is peer reviewed and lender-ready on the first submission—no revisions, no back-and-forth, just clean approvals that keep your project moving.
Sure, we have the AACI designation—that's table stakes. But designations don't tell full story. We understand construction draws or why your property will achieve that market rental or cap rate. We do, because we've sat on your side of the table. We've sweated the same deadlines, fought the same battles with lenders, and know exactly what keeps developers and investors up at night.
Think of us as your inside advantage. While traditional appraisers see numbers on a spreadsheet, we see the story behind your project—the vision, the challenges, the opportunity. That perspective transforms a routine valuation into strategic intelligence that actually helps you close more deals with confidence.
Bottom line? When your appraiser has actually been a developer and an owner, you get more than a report—you get a partner who genuinely understands what's at stake.
