# Valta Website - Project Context for Agents

## üéØ What This Project Does

Marketing website for **Valta Property Valuations Ltd.**, a professional property appraisal company based in Calgary, Alberta.

**Primary Goals:**
1. Showcase appraisal services (residential, commercial, multifamily)
2. Capture leads through contact form
3. Provide detailed property appraisal request intake (planned)
4. Build trust through professional presentation

## üîß Key Technologies

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Email**: Resend API via Supabase Edge Functions
- **Deployment**: Vercel (auto-deploy from main branch)
- **Version Control**: GitHub (ben-crowe/valta-website-staging)

## üö® Critical Things to Know

### **Never Touch These:**
- `.vercel/project.json` - Deployment configuration (working perfectly)
- `.env.local` - Contains live credentials (never commit)
- Supabase edge functions - Contact form email is working (don't break it!)
- PROJECT-NOTES/ folder structure - Client prefers this organization

### **Always Test Production:**
- Production URL: https://valta.ca
- NEVER test localhost for final verification
- Vercel deploys automatically from main branch (~2-3 minutes)
- Check Vercel dashboard before declaring "deployed"

### **Organizational Pattern:**
- Numbered folders (00-Archive, 02-AppraisalForm, 03-LeadForm, 04-Images)
- PROJECT-NOTES/ for client-facing documentation
- docs/ for technical documentation
- .agent/ for agent-specific context (this folder)

## üìß Contact Form Status

**‚úÖ WORKING - DO NOT BREAK THIS**

- URL: /contact
- Backend: `/supabase/functions/send-contact-notification/`
- Database: `contact_submissions` table in Supabase
- Email: Sends to bc@crowestudio.com (temporary, will be clientcare@valta.ca)
- Fields: name, email, phone, company, message, source_url

**Key Details:**
- Database-first approach (never lose data, even if email fails)
- Email template is intentionally plain (no colors, no urgency)
- Company field must stay beside phone field (design decision)
- Source URL always included in notifications

## üöß Appraisal Form Status

**‚ö†Ô∏è PLANNING PHASE - NOT IMPLEMENTED**

- Blueprint exists: `/02-AppraisalForm/APPRAISAL-FORM-BLUEPRINT.md`
- Basic code started but needs completion
- Multi-step form with property details
- Separate database table: `appraisal_requests`
- Estimated 44 hours of development
