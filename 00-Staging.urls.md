-- Sept:18.25 Links to Staging URLs -- https://valta-frontend-staging-2025.vercel.app
  is the correct URL to review all changes.

  Let me clarify the two URLs:

  1. Production URL
  (https://valta-frontend-staging-2025.vercel.app) - This is
  your main staging site. When we run vercel --prod, it updates
   this URL. This is the stable link you should bookmark and
  use for reviewing changes.
  2. Preview/Deployment URLs (like
  https://valta-frontend-staging-2025-edaosnl6f.vercel.app) -
  These are unique URLs created for each deployment. They're
  useful for testing specific versions but the random suffix
  changes each time.

  Use the production URL
  (https://valta-frontend-staging-2025.vercel.app) for all your
   reviews. It will always show the latest deployed changes.

  The header changes are live there now:
  - ✅ Taller header (64px instead of 48px)
  - ✅ Better spacing between logo and navigation
  - ✅ More breathing room between menu items

  Whenever we make changes and I deploy with vercel --prod,
  this URL will automatically update within seconds.
